- 👋 Hi, I’m @madstroldborg
- 👀 I have general interest in environmental risk assessment, modelling and uncertainty estimation. 
- :nerd_face: I'm particularly interested in contaminant transport & fate in the environment and the associated exposure and risks.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about Bayesian Networks, R shiny and lots of other cool topics, including risk of AMR (!). 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that matches my interests :)
- 📫 How to reach me: mads.troldborg@hutton.ac.uk
